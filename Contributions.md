## How do I Contribute?

Please submit a pull request, all you have to do is click the edit button, and then click the ```propose new file``` button, and then the ```create new pull request``` button.

When you contribute, please select the correct ```year```, then the correct ```round```, then paste the problem name in the format ```ECOO ' Year Round # Question # Problem Name```.

So ```ECOO 2018 Round 1 Problem 1: "Willow's Wild Ride``` becomes ```ECOO '18 R1 P1 - Willow's Wild Ride```, see the problems on [DMOJ](https://dmoj.ca/) for further formating information.

For each of the problems, I would like an ```Analysis.md``` file, basically an ```editorial``` for the problem, describing the solution to the problem in markdown language.
