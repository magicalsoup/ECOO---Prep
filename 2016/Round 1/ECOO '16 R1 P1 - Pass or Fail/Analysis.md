# Analysis
This problem asks us to find out how many students passed given the weight of tests, assignments, projects, quizzes and the mark the
student got for each one. 

Loop through all the students, multiply their mark by the weight then divide by 100
``` 
if(test * WeightT / 100 + assignments * WeightAt / 100 + project * WeightP / 100 + quiz * WeightQ / 100 >= 49.9) counter++; 
```
