# Analysis

For this problem, the hardest part is reading the input, divide the large board into a ```4 x 4``` board, then for each board you can further divide into smaller ```4 x 4``` boards, making a 4D array of ```board[4][4][4][4]```.

Then try each character, from the smallest to biggest, and just check, exactly like the problem statement.
