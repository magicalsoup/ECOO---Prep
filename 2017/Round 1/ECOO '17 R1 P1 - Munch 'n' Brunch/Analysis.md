# Analysis

Simply follow what the problem says:

```	money = y1 * n * 12, b = y2 * n * 10, c = y3 * n * 7, d = y4 * n * 5```

where ```y1, y2, y3, y4``` are the percentages of the students in each grade respectively

then just see if ```money / 2``` is greater or equal to the amount of money needed for the trip.
